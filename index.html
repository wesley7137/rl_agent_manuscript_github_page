        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Aging represents a complex biological process involving a progressive decline in physiological function, driven by various interconnected cellular pathways. Traditional drug discovery methods targeting individual pathways have consistently struggled to address the multifactorial nature of aging. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to synthesize novel compounds that modulate multiple aging-related pathways simultaneously. By employing multi-objective optimization, advanced molecular representations using ChemBERTa, and a multi-agent architecture, this system efficiently navigates the chemical space, overcoming limitations inherent in conventional approaches. Iterative training, involving curriculum learning and prioritized experience replay, has enabled RL agents to generate diverse, drug-like molecules with significant multi-functional potential, targeting pathways such as autophagy induction, epigenetic modulation, and mitochondrial enhancement. The results present a substantial step forward in computational drug design, establishing a promising path for discovering efficacious anti-aging therapeutics.</p>
